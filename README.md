# Therapeutic-Drug-Classification

This project was made on scope of the course Introduction to
Bioinformatics in the University of Coimbra. The objective of this work is
to classify drugs in 18 specic therapeutic drug families, using the KEGG
database. With this database it was possible to extract exact mass, mol
weight and formula for 1491 dierent drugs. After implementing and
testing various clustering and machine learning methods, it became clear
that the mol weight and exact mass of the drug were not statistically
signicant for this problem. However, by using the formula, we were able
to achieve 46% accuracy and 39% recall rates across the 18 dierent
classes and a 87% accuracy, 89% sensibility and 80% specicity on a
classier built to dierentiate only one class (Antineoplastics) from the
rest of the drugs.
